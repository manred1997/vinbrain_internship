down. follow up abdominal/pelvic ct on demonstrated enlargement of the previously seen fluid collection and appearance of the numerous new large collections in the peritoneum. the drained collection had significantly decreased in size. on, the patient returned to interventional radiology for drainage of an anterior collection, and placement of a new drainage catheter to gravity. the previous drain was removed, and upper abdominal pseudocyst was succesfully drained with a catheter left in place to gravity. unfortunately, as noted above, he developed an accumulating posterior retroperitoneal cyst, which continued to progress, and there was evidence of a disconnected pancreatic remnant within it. he underwent external drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst and extended adhesiolysis as described above. a (l) flank drain was left in place. after the surgery, his symptoms improved. id admission blood cultures were negative. fluid culture had no growth. on after receiving ffps, the patient mounted a fever with a tmax xxx.x po. blood cultures were negative. fluid cutlure from the drainage also revealed no growth. the patient s white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection. admission mrsa screen was negative. after the surgery, cultures from the peritoneal fluid on, the (l) jp on, and the flank drain on all grew out mrsa. the patient had been started on empiric iv vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and flagyl when he spiked a temperature on. fluconazole for empiric coverage after the thorocentesis was started on. flagyl, cipro, and fluconazole were discontinued on. cipro restarted on. infectious disease was consulted for discharge antibiotic recommendations their input was greatly appreciated. cipro was discomntinued, and oral levofloxacin and flagyl started on with vancomycin continued. at discharge, the patient was sent home on a two week course oral linezolid, and a total of four weeks of oral levofloxacin and flagyl. endocrine the patient s blood sugar was monitored throughout his stay when he was on tpn sliding scale insulin was administered accordingly. he did not require exogenous insulin. hematology upon admission, coumadin was stopped, and the patient received x untis of fresh frozen plasma (ffps) prior to fluid collection drainage in intervention radiology. on, ffps were again administered in preparation for ir drainage of a large anterior abdominal fluid collection, but was stopped after the patient experienced severe lower back pain after initiation of the second unit of ffp. on, he received a total of x units of ffps prior to ir drainage of the aforementioned collection. prior to surgery, the patient received x units of prbcs for a hct of xx.he did not require any further blood products after this date. at discharge, his hct was x.prophylaxis history left common iliac dvt and hits. repeat duplex ultra sound on admission confirmed persistent non occlusive thrombus in the left common femoral vein no right dvt was seen. chest cta did not reveal a pe. on admission, coumadin stopped, and agatroban started. after the drainage of the collection on, agatroban was stopped, and coumadin restarted. coumadin also restarted after reversal for second collection drainage. after the surgery on, the patient was restarted on argatroban. he was again converted back to coumadin prior to discharge, at which time the inr was therapeutic at x.x on a coumadin dose of x.xmg daily. inr goal x.x with a therapeutic range of. mobility the patient worked with physical and occupation therapy extensively. by discharge, he was able to ambulate independently. he was discharge home with pt and ot services. at the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs. the patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating with minimal assistance, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled. he was discharged home with vna and pt services. the patient received discharge teaching and follow up instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan. \\n',\n",
